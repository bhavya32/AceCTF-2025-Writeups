Write-up: Another Reading Between the Lines?

Challenge Analysis:
    •    The file hidden is an ASCII text file with different line break formats (CRLF and LF).
    •    Running strings did not reveal any clear text, indicating hidden data using an unconventional method.

Solution Approach:
    
Analyze the file and detect different newline patterns (\r\n and \n).
Identify that CRLF = 1 and LF = 0, indicating a binary encoding technique.
Convert the binary representation into ASCII text to extract the flag.
